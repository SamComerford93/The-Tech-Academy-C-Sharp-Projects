### Twenty One Game

This is a console app where you can play 21 against the dealer. It uses objects throughout the application such as a Deck for the cards, a Dealer object and a Player object plus more. You can place bets before every game and win or lose money from your wallet. This game deals cards to both player and dealer and gives the option to hit or stay. There is exception handling implemented throughout to avoid errors and also logs cards that have been dealt to a text document.

### School Students

This program has been built using the code first method and the Entity Framework to build a program that can store the data for students and their grades within a school. There has been a database created using the code first method where all the data will be stored and accessed.

### Car Insurance 

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes in user's input for their information and creates a quote based on a set criteria. This stores all the data in a database that can be access by an admin page that allows staff to view all the quotes that have been issued.

### Package Quote App

This application can take in the dimensions of a package and can return a quote for the cost of delivery of this package. It also has parameters for packages that are too big and shows a message to the user if they are unable to deliver.

### Salary Comparison

This console app takes input from two user's about their pay. This then carries out a comparison of their overall salary and returns a message confirming the result of the comparison.

### Car Insurance Approval

This console app takes user's input and using comparison operators will return whether they are eligible for insurance or not.
